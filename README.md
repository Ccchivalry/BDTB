# BDTB
A scrawler python file for BaiDuTieBa article based on python2.7.
This .py file is used for:
1. Scrawing any article of any choosen users from BaiDuTieBa,
2. Writing the contents into a txt file,
3. and Saving the complete .txt file in the same directory as your .py location.

Attention:
In the main code.py, the letter 'u' before string should not be arbitrarily erased out, for this may cause the txt file writing failure due to the encode format.
